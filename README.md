Initial Test indicated this worked without a problem. 

I don't know how to break the connection with GitHub, but in our test case, that's what happened. 
Later, user tries to reconenct but it only creates a new app if initiated via GitHub.
So they moved to connecting via App Center directly to GitHub.
Now, PR requests do not get completed and therefore, workflows stop/slow down until those can be resolved. 

Transfer App and attempting once more to initiate a PR Check

This ended up working just fine - no problem to report. We're unable to replicate the behavior reported.
